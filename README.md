->This project utilizes the genric nature of the OpenAI's Assitant API and let's a user create a chain of new bots that could be made more & more targeted for a single use down the chain meaning it could be utilized for inter-connected follow up tasks and creation of new bots for it and vice-versa, the instruction prompt that is default is quite genric and simple although specific prompt input can also be enabled

->It's a basic ongoing work that I'm going to further optimize , widening the usecases.

->Interesting additions are welcomed.
